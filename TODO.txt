========================================

SHORT TERM:
- Make wrappers for:
	- Overload Compress, make different calls, use PyConfig object. (Will)
    
-There is a bug in Data.setvalue()  It throws a segfault on repeated calls/when looping over the data structure.
-Try fused types (Will)
-Make wrapper for Factorize (Sameer)

LONGER TERM:
- Numpy to Data
- Decide and implement interface for custom kernels
- Distributed and GPU implementations
