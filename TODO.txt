========================================

SHORT TERM:
- Make wrappers for:
	- Data         (Sameer)
	- SPDMatrx     (Sameer)
	- centersplit  (Will)
	- randomsplit  (Will)
	- tree
	- Compress/Evaluate

- Make python classes to wrap c_enums (hmlpError, kernel_s, DistanceMetrc), edit .pyx to take these in and convert (Will)

- Figure out how to have CMakeList.txt glob all pyx and pxd files and configure them
- Automate generation of setup.py to include all extensions (i.e. "pyconfig.pyx", "PyData.pyx", etc)
OR
- Just merge the files together once we get all the pieces working

LONGER TERM:

- Decide and implement interface for custom kernels
- Make wrapper for Factorize
- Distributed and GPU implementations
