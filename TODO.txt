========================================

SHARED MEMORY IMPLEMENTATION
- Soft copy bug (Sameer)
- Numpy to Data (Sameer)
- Compute error function (Sameer)
- PyTreeKM or Inherit from Virtual Matrix  (Sameer)

- Easier to use/more intuitive nearest neighbor function (Will)
- How to pass in a custom cython kernel function (Will)
- How to pass in a custom python kernel function (Will)
- Clean up (Will)

DISTRIBUTED MEMORY IMPLEMENTATION
Notes:
    - There is only a distributed version of the kernel matrix container. There is no SPDMatrix equivalent. 
    - I've not tested anything with multiple MPI workers yet, this is a major TODO
    - Theres a bug that Compress is returning hmlp::tree::Tree instead of hmlp::mpitree::Tree
-DistData
    -Notes: 
            -DistData has many different data distributions, they're developed to very different degrees and have different methods
            -The two used by chenhans gofmm are STAR_CBLK and RBLK_STAR for column-major matrices and vectors respectively 
            -Only STAR_CBLK has a read function, there '=' is overloaded to convert and redistribute between them. 

    -Need:
            -  python wrapper for RBLK_STAR DistData type (for weights and matvec results)
            -  python wrapper for overloaded operators 
                - ()
                    - a = PyData(). Do we want a.get(i, j), or just a[i, j], for submatrices should we support slicing?
                - = 
                    - a.redistribute 
            - numpy to DistData object. 
                - built piece by piece with local arrays
                - built with array then scattered

-Compress
    -Notes:
            -Assumes we're passing nearest neighbor list
    - Need:
        - pxd code and python wrapper for nearest neighbor function
        - python wrapper for compress that calls nearest neighbor function 


-Evaluate
    - all of it

-Factorize
    - all of it



LONGER TERM:

-There is a bug in Data.setvalue()  It throws a segfault on repeated calls/when looping over the data structure.
Could this be related to our soft copy bug? Nope it's unrelated.
