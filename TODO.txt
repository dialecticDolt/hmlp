========================================

SHORT TERM:
- Soft copy bug (Sameer)
- Numpy to Data (Sameer)
- Compute error function (Sameer)

- PyTreeKM or Inherit from Virtual Matrix  (Sameer)

- Make wrappers for:
	- Overload Compress, make different calls, use PyConfig object. (Will)
- Try fused types (Will)
- Nearest neighbor function (Will)


- Define your own kernel -- how to link? (Will)
- Clean up (Will)

LONGER TERM:

-There is a bug in Data.setvalue()  It throws a segfault on repeated calls/when looping over the data structure.
Could this be related to our soft copy bug?
- Distributed and GPU implementations, test mpi
